# Python Basics

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python programs covering the
fundamentals of programming. It is designed as a clear, practical, and
well-structured reference for anyone starting their Python journey.

The examples focus on core concepts through simple, readable scripts that
emphasize clarity, correctness, and good coding practices.

## 📚 Concepts Covered

- Variables and data types
- Input and output handling
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and parameters
- Python data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Error and exception handling
- Modules and imports
- Regular expressions (basic to intermediate usage)
